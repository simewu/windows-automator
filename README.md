# Windows Automator
Create bots, automate yourself using C#. This bot was built to simulate human interaction as realistically as possible, by moving the mouse, typing, clicking, and pressing keys in such a way that it is indistinguishable from a human.

Rather than limiting the user, the application takes advantage of C# reflection to allow the user to customize their bot however they please, then save/load their bot files.
